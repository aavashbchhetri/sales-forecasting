<h2>Sales Forecasting Using Machine Learning</h2>

This project focuses on predicting weekly sales for multiple stores and departments using <b>historical sales, store metadata, and economic indicators</b>. The data from three sources—<b>sales, store features, and store details </b>—was merged and cleaned. Feature engineering included extracting temporal features such as year, month, and week, as well as encoding categorical variables.

A <b>Random Forest Regressor</b> was trained to forecast weekly sales, and the model’s performance was evaluated using metrics such as predicted vs actual sales and residual analysis. Visualizations were created to analyze sales trends, seasonality, feature importance, and the relationship between predictors and sales.

The project demonstrates how machine learning can effectively capture patterns in sales data and provide actionable insights for forecasting and decision-making.
